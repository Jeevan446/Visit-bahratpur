        <div id="act_img"><img src="./images/junglesafari.jpeg" alt=""></div>
        <p id="act_des">Embarking on a jungle safari in Chitwan National Park offers an immersive experience into one of
            Nepal's most biodiverse and culturally rich regions. Spanning over 900 square kilometers of subtropical
            lowlands in southern Nepal, Chitwan is renowned for its lush forests, expansive grasslands, and winding
            rivers that sustain a remarkable array of wildlife, earning its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage site.

            The jungle safari typically begins with a serene river journey aboard a traditional dugout canoe, gliding
            along the Rapti or Narayani River. This tranquil excursion offers glimpses of crocodiles basking on
            riverbanks, vibrant birdlife flitting through overhanging branches, and possibly even a playful otter
            darting through the water.

            Embarking on a jeep safari in Chitwan National Park is an exhilarating journey into the heart of Nepal's
            wildlife and natural beauty. Spanning over 900 square kilometers of subtropical lowlands in southern Nepal,
            this UNESCO World Heritage site is renowned for its rich biodiversity and successful conservation efforts,
            making it a premier destination for nature enthusiasts and adventure seekers alike.

            The jeep safari offers a unique opportunity to explore the diverse habitats of Chitwan, from dense Sal
            forests to open grasslands and meandering rivers, all teeming with a remarkable array of wildlife. As you
            traverse the park in a sturdy 4x4 vehicle, guided by experienced naturalists and local experts, every turn
            unveils a new discovery: majestic Bengal tigers stealthily prowling through the underbrush, elusive
            one-horned rhinoceroses grazing peacefully by the riverbanks, and vibrant birdlife filling the air with
            their calls.

        <div id="act_img"><img src="./images/Canoeing.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <p id="act_des">
            Canoeing in Chitwan National Park offers a tranquil and immersive way to explore the pristine wilderness of
            southern Nepal. Beginning with a serene glide along the Rapti or Narayani River, visitors embark on
            traditional dugout canoes guided by skilled boatmen who navigate the gentle currents and meandering
            channels. This leisurely journey allows for intimate encounters with the park's rich biodiversity:
            crocodiles sunning on riverbanks, colorful birdlife flitting through the canopy, and perhaps even glimpses
            of elephants bathing along the shore.

            The experience unfolds amidst breathtaking natural scenery, where dense forests and lush grasslands line the
            riverbanks, providing a picturesque backdrop for wildlife sightings and photography. The tranquil ambiance
            allows visitors to immerse themselves in the sights and sounds of nature, with the occasional rustle of
            leaves or splash of water marking the passage of wildlife along the river's edge.

        <h3 id="act_title" class="act_title">4) Tharu culture</h3>
        <div id="act_img"><img src="./images/Tharu-Dance.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <p id="act_des">

            Tharu cultural dances in Chitwan, Nepal, offer a vibrant celebration of tradition and community amidst the
            backdrop of this biodiverse region. The Tharu people, indigenous to the Terai plains of Nepal, have a rich
            cultural heritage deeply rooted in their close relationship with the natural world. Their dances, often
            performed during festivals and special occasions, reflect their spiritual beliefs, agricultural practices,
            and harmonious coexistence with the surrounding environment.

            Typically accompanied by rhythmic drumming and melodious chanting, Tharu dances showcase intricate footwork
            and expressive movements that tell stories of their history and daily lives. Each dance is imbued with
            symbolism, from the rhythmic "Maghi" dance celebrating the harvest season to the energetic "Jhumra" dance
            performed to ward off evil spirits and invoke blessings for prosperity.
